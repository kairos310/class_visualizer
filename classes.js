Due to this separation, humans were elevated above nature and nature was regarded solely as a passive resource to be controlled and exploited. This destructive human-nature distinction did not remain confined to what was human and what was not. It created categories of sub-humans, which included non-European non-Christian people from the Americas to Southeast Asia, as well as women. What emerged out of enlightenment was a patriarchal system which viewed nature and non-Western people as primitive and exploitable.\nIn this course we explore this history and its consequences in the past, present, and future.

Heretofore South Africa had been ruled by whites for the benefit of\n\twhites with a system of racial domination called apartheid (from 1948) and which kept the white minority in power with a combination\n\tof economic dependency, political exploitation, psychological manipulation and violent repression. The inherent inhumanity of apartheid\n\tcreated an international outcry and spawned a global human rights movement which, along with internal political action by the black\n\tmajority, helped move South Africa toward a non-racial government. Essential to that movement were images of life inside the apartheid\n\tsystem which were seen via a set of documentary films. The earlier documentary films we will see both not only showed the truth of\n\twhat happened on the ground but also became artifacts of the struggle itself. It is for this reason that we will use documentaries to tell the\n\tstory of South Africa's transition from apartheid to freedom.

Up to a point, science fiction allows us to objectively see the aspirations and taboos of our intellectual and ideological landscape. But what is then the relation between science fiction and utopia? In this course, we will widely question the limits of these two concepts by bringing together the expertise of a whole variety of scholars from both Rhodes and the Memphis community, from the fields of Modern Languages, Physics, English, Russian, Biology, Neuroscience, Gender Studies and Film Studies. We will go far beyond the limits of Anglo-Saxon cultural production and engage a body of international cultural texts and films, which could help us understand the limits and points of contact of each tradition/culture. The possibility of bringing into the picture of cultural analysis not just humanists, but also scientists from different fields, will allow us to expand the concept of \u201cutopia\u201d beyond its understanding within the literary tradition and to explore the \u201cutopic\u201d component of the different sciences as well."}, "/lang/280": {"course": "LANG 280 Introduction to General Linquistics", "semester": "Spring", "prerequisites": [], "description": "The Introduction to General Linguistics course presents language as a specific object of knowledge, thought, science, and philosophy.\n\tStudents will be introduced to the major linguistic theories and examine language as a system and structure at its various levels, as well\n\tas a tool to guide, plan, and monitor human activity.
